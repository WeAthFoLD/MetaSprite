# MetaSprite

MetaSprite is an Unity plugin that lets you import [Aseprite][aseprite]'s .ase file into Unity, as Mecanim animation clips/controllers. It also has rich **metadata support** built in, allowing one to manipulate colliders, change transforms, send messages (and much more!) easily in Aseprite.

MetaSprite is currently in early developement stage.
